        I'm in the business of creating fairy tales.
        Theme parks. Production companies. Five-star hotels.
        Everything could be all mine if I renovated Dreamland.

        Instead, Rowan Kane offered me a dream job.</p>

    <p>As a third-year Ph.D. candidate, Olive Smith doesn't believe in lasting romantic relationships--but her best friend does, and that's what got her into this situation. Convincing Anh that Olive is dating and well on her way to a happily ever after was always going to take more than hand-wavy Jedi mind tricks: Scientists require proof. So, like any self-respecting biologist, Olive panics and kisses the first man she sees.</p>
