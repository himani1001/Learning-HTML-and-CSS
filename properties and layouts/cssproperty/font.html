    <h1>The shutout</h1>
    <p>The characters and events portrayed in this book are fictitious. Any similarity to real persons, living
        or dead, is coincidental and not intended by the author.</p>
    <p>The themes in this book do not reflect my beliefs and are a work of
        fiction, exploring realities that still exist within our world. Themes include,
        but are not limited to, discussions of homophobia, loss of a loved one, adult
        language, a physical altercation, and consensual sexual content.</p>
